                    trade-off, existing inference solutions adopt con-        sequence through multiple denoising iterations, achieving
                    servative parallel strategies, leaving substantial        surprisingly strong performance on text generation tasks.

                    lenge is that parallel decoding assumes each po-          of AR models, including the inability to decode in parallel

               Weconductourexperimentsonseveral variants of two models: LLaDA-8B-Instruct (Nie et al., 2025), LLaDA-1.5 (Zhu
               et al., 2025), Dream-v0-Base-7B (Ye et al., 2025), Dream-v0-Instruct-7B. Benchmarks include diverse datasets: GSM8K
               (5-shot) (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (4-shot) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), HumanEval (0-shot) (Chen, 2021), and MBPP
               (3-shot) (Austin et al., 2021), covering a range of reasoning and code generation tasks. Across all settings, we fix the block
               size to 32 and generation length to 256 tokens except KLASS, which uses its best-performing block length.
               All baselines are evaluated under their default hyperparameter settings. To identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration
               for our method DAWN on different models, including τ          , τ        and τ     , we conduct a grid search on the HumanEval

               dataset. Specifically, we evaluate a range of candidate values for each parameter and plot the corresponding Accuracy–TPS
               curves, visualized in Fig 7, 8, 9, 10.

               In most cases, we observe a clear trade-off between throughput and accuracy: higher throughput is generally achieved at
               the cost of reduced accuracy. To balance this trade-off, we select hyperparameter values that lie near the Pareto frontier,
                                                                               12

               Figure 10. We vary the threshold τedge, τinduced, τsink and report accuracy (blue, left y-axis) and throughput TPS (red, right
               y-axis) on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B. The dashed lines (yellow) mark the final settings τ     =0.10, τ         =0.75, τ     =0.03.

                favoring configurations that preserve high accuracy while providing meaningful efficiency gains. For example, on the
                LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, we select τ            =0.07, which achieves the highest accuracy among the tested values while
                                                           edge
                offering higher throughput compared to τ         =0.08. This criterion ensures that the chosen configuration does not sacrifice
                                                           edge
                accuracy for marginal speed improvements.
                For the the lower confidence threshold τ       hyperparameter, we perform a grid search over both models and benchmarks,

                resulting in 16 experimental settings in total. Within each setting, we further tune the method-specific hyperparameters to
                obtain the best-performing configuration. The final selected results are reported in Table 3.

                B. Discussion
               This work is primarily motivated by the challenge of nonindependent position predictions in dLLMs, which suggests that
                decoding order should account for dependencies among positions. In many existing analyses and methods, high confidence
                is often treated as a sufficient indicator of per-position consistency or approximate independence, and the resulting update
                rules largely rely on such conservative criteria, which can limit achievable parallelism and leave a substantial portion of
                dLLMparallel potential underexploited. In contrast, this work attempts to capture positional coupling more directly and to
                derive corresponding decoding strategies from these dependency relations.
               Viewing dLLMdecodingthrough the lens of positional dependencies provides a complementary perspective that can more
                directly address the persistent difficulty of parallel decoding under non-independence. It is hoped that this study will
                encourage further investigation into dependency structures in dLLMs and inspire more efficient inference methods that
                leverage them.
